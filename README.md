**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ZiyangLin/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a series of bash scripts and SQL scripts to automate the process of setting up PostgreSQL server and Docker, and record hardware specifications and monitor hardware usages in a cluster network of Linux servers for SQL analysis such as detecting server failures.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ZiyangLin/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a client-server architecture application that interacts with the Twitter API to allow users to post, show, and delete tweets with a command-line interface.
  - JDBC App: Implemented an application with DAO pattern with JDBC to model objects in a retailer database and perform CRUD operations with them.
  - Grep App: Implemented a Java application that reproduces the functionalities of grep command in Linux, which can search for all occurrences of a regular expression in a root directory and write them to an output file.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ZiyangLin/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed a dockerized Spring Boot based stock trading REST API application that allows individual trader to create and view trading account, deposit or withdraw funds, and submit market orders for stocks in the daily list on an HTML page or through REST endpoints. The application features a 3-tier architecture in which the client UI is displayed using a Swagger UI, and the database component is managed by a PostgreSQL database that connects to the IEX Cloud API for real-time stock quote data updates.
